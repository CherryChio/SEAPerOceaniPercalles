        PACE is NASA’s <em> Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission, </em> designed to help us better understand how the oceans and atmosphere exchange carbon dioxide, as well as the impact of aerosols for phytoplankton growth in the ocean based on the oceans’ color.</p>
      <p>It’s about as long as a basketball net in height and its width and depth are about 5 feet each, or a typical park branch.      </p>
      <p>PACE is an important new tool to help us better understand our changing planet. It’s designed to build upon more than 20 years of earth observation data from other’s missions and work with other spacecraft currently in orbit. </p>
      <p>On February 1st, SpaceX encapsulated the spacecraft inside Falcon 9 payload fairings, and rolled it out to space launch complex 40 at Cape Canaveral space force station ahead of its planned launch.
      </p>
      <p><strong>PACE’s three main instruments: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OCI:</strong> It has a two and a half thousand kilometer swath and sees from the deep ultraviolet all the way to the infrared, and we’ll see the whole globe in full color everyday. <br> It’s like if today we had a box of 8 crayons in it, and PACE delivered a box of 128 crayons. All of these additional colors of the spectrum allows us to see things that we can’t currently see with other satellites.</li>
        <li><strong>HARP2:</strong> The Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter, allows us to see cloud bows. The shape of a cloud bow tells us what size droplets contained in clouds are. </li>
        <li><strong>SPEXone:</strong> The Spectral Polarimeter for Planetary Observation is able to observe from ultraviolet wavelengths into the near infrared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These two last polarimeters are complementary to the main spectrometer instrument. Understanding the ocean colors we detect with these instruments will teach us about the microorganisms living there, called phytoplankton.</p>
      <p>All of the oceanic life starts with phytoplankton. That's where energy comes in and where carbon comes out. As such, everything that happens later in the ocean is determined by these little microorganisms.      </p>
      <p><strong>PACE data will benefit us in this areas:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural resource managers </strong>focused on water quality for human health, commercial fishing and disaster management.        </li>
        <li><strong>Researchers </strong>in the fields of ocean biology, ecology, biogeochemistry, atmospheric aerosols, and clouds.        </li>
        <li><strong>Military users </strong>of data for environment characterization and weather and visibility forecasts for regions of operations.        </li>
        <li><strong>Government agencies </strong>for managing fisheries and determining human health predictors.        </li>
        <li>Renewable energy and <strong>commercial sectors </strong>with interest in environmental technology, development, resources, management tools, and environmental forecasting.        </li>
        <li><strong>Educators </strong>of the general public.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy makers and economists </strong>at local, state, regional, tribal, federal and international levels.        </li>
      </ul>
