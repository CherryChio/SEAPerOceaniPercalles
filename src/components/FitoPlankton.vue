        <p>The reason why <strong>phytoplankton</strong>, minuscule organisms <strong>smaller than the width of a human hair</strong>, are critical for ocean ecosystems is that they <strong>power the ecosystems themselves</strong>. As microscopic flora, they provide food to microscopic fauna — <strong>zooplankton</strong>. These second organisms can also be preyed upon by larger zooplankton. Gradually, this <strong>food chain</strong> increases in terms of the size of creatures, until it ultimately reaches humans.</p>

        <p>The key driving factor behind the <strong>food chain</strong> is a <strong>transfer of energy</strong>. We humans obtain energy from our food, <strong>fish</strong>, for instance. And consequently, fish obtain it from smaller fish, until it reaches <strong>phytoplankton</strong>, who produce their own energy via <strong>sunlight and carbon dioxide</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>To deepen knowledge:</strong></p>
        
        <p>Even though <strong>phytoplanktons</strong> are small organisms, they have <strong>immense populations in the ocean</strong>. Often, one of the most common organic components in their possession is a <strong>green pigment</strong> called <strong>chlorophyll</strong>. Chlorophyll is what allows phytoplankton to <strong>produce their own food (energy) via sunlight and carbon dioxide</strong>, through a process called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>. This makes them <strong>autotrophic organisms</strong> (“self-feeding” organisms).</p>

        <p>Other life forms that depend on others as sources of food, from <strong>humans to whales</strong>, are known as <strong>heterotrophic organisms</strong>.</p>

        <p>Understanding how <strong>micro changes in phytoplankton</strong> macroscopically impact <strong>ocean ecosystems</strong> allows us to comprehend why these ecosystems are the way they are, and how to contribute to the solution of <strong>environmental problems</strong> — be it a <strong>reduction of microflora</strong> or the <strong>rise of toxic phytoplankton</strong>.</p>
