          <p><strong>The ocean</strong> is a mass of water which extends through the majority of our planet. It is the home of many different forms of life, and is constantly in motion. But it is not a single, constant habitat! Just like dry land, where we can find deserts, forests, and jungles, <strong>oceans have multiple environments</strong> too.</p>

          <p>The diversity of species in the ocean doesn’t solely depend on the diversity of habitats, however: this is where <strong>phytoplankton</strong> comes in. Phytoplankton are <strong>microscopic algae</strong> that float in the ocean. They have many distinct shapes and sizes between one and another, as well as their particular chemical processes. Therefore, the diversity of phytoplankton is a key factor in determining the roles they play in their ocean habitats.</p>

          <p><strong>Comprehending phytoplankton</strong> is critical when selecting from which ocean area we select our food, which habitats are in distress, as well as discovering how the inner workings of these microscopic organisms impact macroscopic phenomena.</p>
