          <p><strong>Carbon</strong> is an element that is present in an immense variety of forms. It may be in the form of <strong>diamonds</strong>, in <strong>invisible particles floating in the air</strong>, or even within us. <strong>Lifeforms on Earth are made of carbon</strong>, and in the ocean’s case, many natural processes influence how carbon changes within mediums. One of these key processes is <strong>photosynthesis via microscopic ocean organisms: phytoplankton</strong>.</p>

          <p>This system allows both <strong>ocean and dry land life</strong>, by regulating the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and converting them into organic matter (which ultimately becomes energy as food sources). It also influences the environment by determining the <strong>availability of food sources</strong> and its variety.</p>

          <p>Other ways of interaction, in the case of the ocean, have many indirect implications. For instance, <strong>large phytoplankton species can sink from the ocean’s surface towards the deep sea</strong>. This descent also serves as a source of food for deep sea zooplankton, and consequently other lifeforms.</p>

          <p>When phytoplankton falls, it <strong>removes carbon from contact with the atmosphere</strong> (picture it as <strong>sinking carbon</strong>). Eventually, once zooplankton processes phytoplankton, or returns to the sea surface, either liberating carbon back to the atmosphere or becoming a food source for yet another species, still contributing to the food chain and its energy transfer quality.</p>

          <p>Therefore, the <strong>PACE satellite</strong> is able to reveal the <strong>diversity of phytoplankton</strong> through multiple measurements from its array of tools, comprehend the relationship between <strong>oceans, phytoplankton, and carbon cycles</strong>, as well as trace and predict the routes carbon throughout the ocean.</p>

          <p><strong>To deepen knowledge</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Carbon</strong> is one of the <strong>best fertilizers</strong> we can get on earth, but its <strong>excess can be detrimental</strong> for the environment. It might not be wise to use one single fertilizer, for instance, as it could <strong>damage the earth</strong> and ultimately make it <strong>infertile soil</strong>.</p>

          <p>Every year, the world’s <strong>vegetation and ocean absorb about half of human-caused CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong>, slowing the rate of greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere. However, <strong>oceans by themselves are not able to counter the totality of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong>.</p>

          <p>In contrast with oceans, we can observe an <strong>accelerated process of absorption in rainforest</strong>. This is due to the <strong>day-night CO<sub>2</sub> cycle</strong>: plants absorb the greenhouse gas during the day via photosynthesis (just like phytoplankton, when the sun is out), and then stop absorbing it at night.</p>
