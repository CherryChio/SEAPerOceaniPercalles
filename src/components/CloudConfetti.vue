        <p>There are many kinds of aerosols, though a simple form of conceptualizing how they may pollute a planet’s atmosphere is the following: not all of them are artificially made. For instance, <strong>volcanoes</strong> are a natural source of aerosol since they release various gasses while active. And all living beings around its area of influence may breathe these aerosols constantly, and it is <strong>highly dangerous for life</strong>.</p>

        <p>Aerosols come in many forms. Natural aerosols include <strong>wildfire smoke</strong>, <strong>volcanic gasses</strong>, or <strong>salty sea spray</strong>. Human activities can also generate aerosols, such as particles of <strong>air pollution</strong> or <strong>soot</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the case of volcanoes, they emit <strong>sulfur dioxide gas</strong>, which combines with water in the atmosphere to form tiny particles that can circle the globe and stay in the air for a few years, depending on how big the volcanic plume is and how high it goes.</p>

        <p><strong>Burning fossil fuels</strong> releases <strong>sulfate particles</strong> and <strong>sulfur dioxide (SO2)</strong> which, like volcanic aerosols, can reflect sunlight and make the atmosphere cooler. Unlike volcanic aerosols, air pollution does not travel very high in the atmosphere, so it only lasts for 3 to 5 days. But air pollution aerosols are produced continuously, so these particles are a constant presence.</p>

        <p><strong>Aerosol air pollution</strong> has made the planet about <strong>0.7°F (0.4°C) cooler</strong> than it otherwise would be, according to the 2021 report by the <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</strong>. For comparison, <strong>greenhouse gas emissions</strong> have added <strong>2.7°F (1.5°C) of warming</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>To deepen knowledge:</strong></p>

        <p>Different kinds of aerosols reflect different quantities of sunlight, a natural source of energy for the planet. <strong>Aerosols’ interactions with clouds</strong> are complex phenomena that vary often on a case-by-case basis. Comprehending the total energy that the Earth absorbs vs. the total energy reflected is one of the objectives of the <strong>PACE satellite</strong>. Most of the light information received by PACE comes precisely from the atmosphere and its aerosol interactions. Therefore, by taking into account these phenomena, the satellite is able to determine which aerosols are present in Earth’s atmosphere and comprehend <strong>cloud-aerosol interactions</strong>.</p>
